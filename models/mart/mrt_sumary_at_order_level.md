{% docs mrt_sumary_at_order_level %}

This model generates a summary of each order with the store and the seller, including the following indicators:

Granularity: store + date

   - Distinct items quantity per order
   - Order revenue

Days without orders are also included, enabling the detection of store or seller operational anomalies and store closures.
This enables the analysis of store and staff performance, with full hierarchical context (seller → manager → store) making it easy to identify sales peaks, the busiest days, and seasonal patterns and compare performance across organizational levels.
