{% docs mrt_products_stocks_vs_sales_monthly %}

This model provides a comprehensive analysis of product stock levels versus sales performance at the store level.

Granularity: product + store

- Stock quantity on hand
- Average monthly sales quantity and revenue
- Days of coverage (how long the stock lasts based on average sales)
- Rotation ratio (sales vs stock)
- Stock status flag (overstock, understock, rupture, normal)

This enables the identification of overstocked products (slow movers), understocked products (high demand), and potential stock ruptures, helping optimize inventory management and maximize revenue.
