{% docs int_dates %}

This model provides a calendar dimension with date data broken down into different levels such as year, month, week and day, as well as information on weekdays and weekends.

Granularity: One row per date.

This enables the creation of data marts with complete date coverage, including days with no activity, facilitating the analysis of trends and seasonal patterns across stores, managers, and salespeople.
